## Intel x86-based hyper-converged infrastructure

Intel x86-based hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is a type of IT infrastructure that combines computing, storage, and networking resources into a single, software-defined platform.

Hyper-converged infrastructure is designed to simplify data center management and reduce hardware costs by consolidating multiple data center components into a single system. Intel x86-based HCI solutions use Intel x86-based servers and storage hardware to provide the necessary compute and storage resources for the platform.

Intel x86-based HCI solutions typically use virtualization software, such as VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V, to abstract the underlying hardware and create a pool of computing and storage resources that can be dynamically allocated to different workloads as needed. The software-defined nature of the platform allows for greater flexibility and scalability, making it easier for organizations to adapt to changing business requirements.

By consolidating compute, storage, and networking resources into a single platform, Intel x86-based HCI solutions can also help reduce hardware and maintenance costs, simplify management, and improve performance and availability. As a result, they are becoming an increasingly popular choice for organizations looking to modernize their data center infrastructure.


## Fabric Switch (8831-25C)

The Fabric Switch 8831-25C is a model of switch used in storage area networks (SANs) for connecting servers and storage devices.

Fabric switches are networking devices that connect servers and storage devices in a SAN, providing high-speed connectivity and allowing data to be transferred quickly and reliably between devices. The Fabric Switch 8831-25C is a Brocade switch, which is now part of Broadcom Limited.

The 8831-25C is a 32 Gbps switch that provides up to 24 ports for connecting servers and storage devices in a SAN. It supports Fibre Channel (FC) and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocols, and is designed to provide high-speed, low-latency connectivity with a high degree of reliability and availability.

The Fabric Switch 8831-25C includes features such as fabric-based quality of service (QoS), which allows administrators to prioritize traffic and allocate bandwidth based on the specific needs of their applications. It also includes advanced diagnostic and troubleshooting tools, including support for Brocade Fabric Vision technology, which provides real-time monitoring and analysis of the SAN fabric to help ensure optimal performance and availability.

Overall, the Fabric Switch 8831-25C is a high-performance switch designed to meet the demands of modern SANs, providing fast, reliable, and flexible connectivity for servers and storage devices.

## Management Switch (8831-S52)

The Management Switch 8831-S52 is a model of switch used for managing and monitoring network devices in data center environments.

Management switches are designed to provide secure and reliable connectivity between network devices, while also providing a range of management and monitoring features that allow administrators to easily configure and troubleshoot their network infrastructure. The 8831-S52 is a Brocade switch, which is now part of Broadcom Limited.

The 8831-S52 is a 1 Gbps switch that provides up to 52 ports for connecting network devices such as servers, switches, routers, and storage devices. It includes features such as advanced security and access control, virtual local area network (VLAN) support, and support for link aggregation, which allows multiple ports to be combined into a single logical link for improved performance and redundancy.

In addition to providing high-speed connectivity, the Management Switch 8831-S52 also includes a range of management and monitoring features. These include support for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which allows administrators to monitor and manage network devices from a central location, as well as support for remote management and configuration via a web-based interface or command-line interface (CLI).

Overall, the Management Switch 8831-S52 is a high-performance switch designed to meet the demands of modern data center environments, providing secure, reliable, and flexible connectivity for network devices, along with advanced management and monitoring capabilities.
