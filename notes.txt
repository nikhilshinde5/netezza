Q. What is Netezza ?
-> Netezza is a data warehousing appliance. Appliance means I don't want to know internal but how it's used, 
just like black-box.
Hardware and Software is pre-bundled and preconfigured.
came in market in 2001

Q. How netezza is different from other data warehouses?
-> OLTP - Oracle, DB2, SQL Server
 

when data warehousing footprint is very small then I can customise the OLTP for data warehousing.
but challenge comes when data grows, then netezza comes into picture.


Netezza sits between data integration and BI tools layer.
